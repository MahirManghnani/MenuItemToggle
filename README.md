# MenuItemToggleLib

A simple Android library to implement a toggle in for a menu bar item. 
The toggle works like the example given on the ["Delightful details"](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/delightful-details.html) page in the Material Design guidelines 
([See this video](http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/v_2/material_ext_publish/0B08MbvYZK1iNWG5ldFpTU3VDd1E/animation-DelightfulDetails-DelightfulDetails-WellCrafted_v01_large_xhdpi.webm)). Take a look at the sample app to see an implementation of how to use it.
